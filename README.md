# Autodesk Maya Rich Presence

This plugin will update your status on Discord depending on your scene and project.

## Instructions

Simply move the RichPresence.mll to your C:/Users/Name/Documents/maya/Version/plug-ins and enable it in your Plugin Manager.

A menu will be added to your menubar at the top called Rich Presence, in here you can change the settings according to your needs. Note that turning it off and on too many times in a row can lead to it crashing, if that happens, restart maya and everything will work as usual. Your settings will be saved even if maya crashes and the same settings will apply across multiple Maya versions.
If you run into issues you can disable the plug-in in the Plugin Manager, doing so will reset everything.
